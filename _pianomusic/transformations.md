Transformations are a collection of six pieces for solo piano written during 2020. 

They explore my feelings and thoughts during this unusual and sometimes difficult time and provide a varied and expressive musical illustration of my different moods and emotions.

Music played a very important role in keeping my mood buoyant and also provided an opportunity for processing some of the strange new experiences that the COVID-19 pandemic created.
