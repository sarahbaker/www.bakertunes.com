This is a solo piano piece that tries to describe the beauty of the sky in mid-autumn.

We have had some beautiful skies this autumn, here in England. The soft blue, streaked with wisps of white cloud contrasts beautifully with the oranges and reds of the leaves on the trees.

It makes me feel peaceful and content to see it.

In the piano piece, the performer need to have a gentle touch and to play the chords lightly, bringing out the tone of the top notes. It should have a wispy, cloud-like sound, so the forte passages should not be over-played.

I have included *Autumn Skies* in my collection of pieces for intermediate piano, [*Day Time Impressions*](https://www.bakertunes.com/pianomusic/day-time-impressions). The pieces all capture a memory from my childhood growing up in the Chiltern Hills, England. Looking at the sky was, and still is, one of my favourite pasttimes, and I felt this piece was fitting for the collection's theme.

They complement my earlier works, [*Night Time Impressions*.](https://www.bakertunes.com/pianomusic/night-time-impressions/)
