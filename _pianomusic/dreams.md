A piece for piano solo inspired by the weird and sometimes disturbing images that come with dreams and nightmares. 

This is the fifth and darkest piece in my collection, Night Time Impressions - a series of 8 piano pieces that takes the performer and listener on a journey from dusk to dawn through the shadows of the night.

Soon available from [Forsyths](https://www.forsyths.co.uk/)
