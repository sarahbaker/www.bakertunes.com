I was fortunate to have several children of my own age living close by. We seemed to be forever making dens, playing out in the street and generally enjoying each others’ company. This piece reflects that sense of well-being.


This is a re-working of an earlier piece, [*Contentment*](https://www.bakertunes.com/pianomusic/contentment/)

Inspired by childhood memories, *Friends* is part of a collection of pieces for intermediate piano, [*Day Time Impressions*](https://www.bakertunes.com/pianomusic/day-time-impressions/). They complement my earlier works, [*Night Time Impressions*.](https://www.bakertunes.com/pianomusic/night-time-impressions/)
