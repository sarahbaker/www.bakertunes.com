The final piece in my collection, Transformations, a series of pieces for solo piano, written during lockdown in 2020.

*Circular* reflects a different mood from the others. It is edgy and argumentative, with short phrases in a dialogue between parts. There is a sense of frustration that the music doesn't seem to go anywhere, and in the end it just gives up.

I have written it to show the reality of emotions during a difficult period, when conversations were not always that easy.
