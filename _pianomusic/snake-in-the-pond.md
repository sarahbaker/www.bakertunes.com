One hot summer I was astonished and scared to see a grass snake cooling off in our garden pond. I watched, both horrified and fascinated, as it rose up from the depths and then disappeared again. Here I portray the sense of the hazy summer afternoon as I peacefully watched the tiny movements of fish in the pond, contrasted with the fear and excitement of seeing the snake appear. 


Inspired by childhood memories, *Snake In The Pond* is part of a collection of pieces for intermediate piano, [*Day Time Impressions*](https://www.bakertunes.com/pianomusic/day-time-impressions/). They complement my earlier works, [*Night Time Impressions*.](https://www.bakertunes.com/pianomusic/night-time-impressions/)
