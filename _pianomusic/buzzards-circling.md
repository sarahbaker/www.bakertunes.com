There is something so calming and restful about watching birds of prey circling in the thermal currents of a summer sky. Growing up in the Chilterns gave me plenty of opportunity to watch buzzards and red kites. This piano solo captures the beauty of their flight as they glide so effortlessly through the air.

Inspired by childhood memories, *Buzzards Circling* is part of a collection of pieces for intermediate piano, *Day Time Impressions*. They complement my earlier works, [*Night Time Impressions*.](https://www.bakertunes.com/pianomusic/night-time-impressions/)
