This musical picture imagines the jaunty urban fox swaggering through the night. I like to think of him pausing to look up and enjoy the starlight, but I suspect he just goes about his business, looking for food and kicking over the dustbins in his hurry!



Inspired by childhood memories, *The Urban Fox* is part of a collection of pieces for intermediate piano, [*Day Time Impressions*](https://www.bakertunes.com/pianomusic/day-time-impressions). They complement my earlier works, [*Night Time Impressions*.](https://www.bakertunes.com/pianomusic/night-time-impressions/)
