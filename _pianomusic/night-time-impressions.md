*Night Time Impressions* are eight pieces which take the performer and listener on a journey from dusk to dawn through the darkness of the night. 

I grew up with woods behind my house, and the nocturnal noises and images that I remember have been used to create these short sound pictures.

The music moves from the tranquillity of dusk and evening mists, to the emerging starlight of twilight. As night falls, the motifs take on a darker quality with shadows and dreams disturbing peace and calm. The night birds and bats swoop and flit past as they seek their prey, but gradually dawn approaches and peaceful sleep is restored. The morning is heralded with the joyful exuberance of the dawn chorus.
