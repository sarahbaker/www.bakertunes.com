I had an image of a snowy landscape stretching outwards, with flurries of beautiful snowflake crystals swirling around, dancing in the moonlight. 

This piano piece captures the tranquility of the snowy world, with the elegant movement of snowflakes contrasting with the stillness of the fallen snow.

I have dedicated it to Yuki Negishi, whose first name means snow. We 'met' in 2020 on Twitter when Yuki was recording a series of piano solos by female composers. She has wonderfully offered to premiere *Snow Gently Falling* in her Boxing Day concert with [CityMusic Live](https://www.ticketsource.co.uk/citymusiclive/yuki-negishi-schumann-ginastera/e-ybojgk).
