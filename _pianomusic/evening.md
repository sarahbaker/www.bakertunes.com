Sometimes music is the language that expresses how you feel more accurately than words.

Evening to me is a unique time and I have very fond memories of being on my own at home, playing the piano in the dark and wallowing in the conflicting emotions of a developing teenager.

As a parent now, I am still beset with conflicting emotions, but occasionally I am able to spend time and reflect as I play.

This is a piano improvisation I did in an evening after I'd finished a busy day of working and parenting.
