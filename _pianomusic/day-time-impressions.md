*Day Time Impressions* are a collection of ten pieces for solo piano inspired by childhood memories of growing up in the Chiltern Hills, Buckinghamshire.

Each piece completes a musical interpretation of a particular memory or event. I have loved recalling such experiences as seeing a grass snake in the pond, watching as a hot air balloon had to make a crash landing outside the house, and the calm tranquility of watching buzzards circling above me.
