Reflections is a piano piece in the key of D minor.

I love minor keys and the added depth of feeling that they can bring to a piece.

This work uses a broken chord pattern in the left hand, supporting the melody in the right. It is structured in a simple ternary form with the main tune returning after the middle section.

There are subtle changes throughout the piece, just as a reflection is often slightly different from the original.
