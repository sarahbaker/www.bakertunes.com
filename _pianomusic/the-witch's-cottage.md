My siblings and I had a fascination with a small cottage nearby. We passed it infrequently so it never grew over-familiar, and was set back from the road in a dark part of the woods. We called it 'the witch's cottage' and every time we passed I imagined I heard her distant cackle as I hoped in vain to catch a glimpse of her.


Inspired by childhood memories, *The Witch's Cottage* is part of a collection of pieces for intermediate piano, [*Day Time Impressions*](https://www.bakertunes.com/pianomusic/day-time-impressions). They complement my earlier works, [*Night Time Impressions*.](https://www.bakertunes.com/pianomusic/night-time-impressions/)
