<big>**I have over thirty yearsâ€™ experience of teaching piano and singing.**</big>

My lessons seek to inspire musicianship and a love of performing and playing, with elements of technique, theory, aural and performance skills included in every lesson.

As an examiner for ABRSM I have a thorough knowledge of exam requirements and standards, and use the ABRSM syllabus as a scheme for progression and motivation, if appropriate.

I teach all ages and abilities, and always try to find the style and genre that suits the individual so that pupils are motivated to practise and improve because they love the pieces they are studying.
