<big>**I have taught music for over 30 years, specialising in piano, voice and music theory.**</big>

I love to inspire in people a love of music and have a holistic approach to performance, interpretation and theoretical understanding. 

Through using music of many different styles and genres, I seek to develop a personal interest in my pupils and motivate practise through enjoyment and understanding. 

My aim is to encourage a life-long interest and passion for music which pupils enjoy throughout their lives.
