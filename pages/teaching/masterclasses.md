<big>**Masterclasses are specially designed to give individual or small group support as you prepare for that important next performance.**</big>

Drawing on my experience as an examiner for ABRSM since 2017, and my 30 years’ experience of teaching, I will work with you to finesse your performance within the framework of communication, interpretation and delivery.

I love to encourage and inspire students of all ages and abilities, and offer 30 or 60 minute sessions online or in person, to help you prepare your programme.

You will receive a summary of the session with suggestions for how to continue to prepare.
