<big>**Online lessons are not limited by geography, and I am open to pupils anywhere in the UK or worldwide.**</big>

I have extensive experience with virtual learning and music performance, and have taught online since 2020.

Online lessons include:

- Regular one-to-one lessons
- Exam preparation for grade exams
- Theory exam preparation
