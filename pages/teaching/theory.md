I love teaching theory! I get really excited about how music notation has developed and how harmonic structure underpins the Western Classical Music tradition. 

I have over 30 years' experience of preparing students for the ABRSM Grade 5 Theory exam. The new on-line exam lends itself to on-line lessons, and I use the ABRSM syllabus to ensure that pupils have a thorough grounding in the essential requirements and elements of the exam. 

Lessons use the structure of the *ABRSM Discovering Music Theory* books and combine games, practical work, explanation and demonstration at the piano. I use tried-and-tested methods for remembering pitch and key signatures, and seek to give pupils a thorough understanding of theory to enhance their musical enjoyment. 

One-to-one and small group lessons available.
