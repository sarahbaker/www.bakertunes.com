[*Summer Garden*](https://www.outoftheark.co.uk/croak.html) is the opening song of my musical, [*Croak!*](https://www.outoftheark.co.uk/croak.html), published by [Out Of The Ark Music](https://www.outoftheark.co.uk/).

This song is the opening number of the musical and is a vibrant depiction of a colourful, busy garden in summer. It sets the tone for a joyful story about how Speedy the tadpole discovers that he has something unexpected and wonderful within him.

The video is a compilation of all the songs from the musical, with *Summer Garden* featuring at the start.

I have written a [blog](https://blog.bakertunes.com/croak-235becfb447d) about the musical and how my childhood memories inspired the story.
