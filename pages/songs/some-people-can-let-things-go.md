I think this song comes at the most poignant moment in my musical [*Change The World Together*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/change-the-world-together). It is the moment when the main character comes to the realisation that, although people around her seem to be giving up, she can't let things go and has to make a change.

It was inspired by the articles and speeches given by the schoolgirl, Greta Thunberg. She was a young girl of sixteen who managed to change so many peoples' perspectives in 2019 by not allowing her age to stop her from protesting about the climate crisis and how policy needs to change globally to keep our enviromental future safe.
