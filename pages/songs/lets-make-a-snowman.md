It's great when there is so much snow that you can build a snowman! 

This is a simple song for younger children about having fun in the snow. I was inspired to write the song by thinking about lots of kids playing together and enjoying the crisp whitness of fresh-fallen snow.

The illustrations were fun to do and gave me a few minutes of relaxation amidst the monotony of lockdown life during the 3rd UK lockdown in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
