[*Easter's Coming!*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/songzone?s=Easter%27s+Coming) is an upbeat song that includes the traditions we share at Easter with the Christian story of Jesus' death and resurrection.

I woke in the middle of the night with the phrase "I'm gonna travel in time to the hill of three crosses". The next thing I knew, I was sitting in the bathroom in the half dark and writing out the chorus of a new song while my husband slept next door. 

The finished song is a joyful celebration of the Easter traditions.
