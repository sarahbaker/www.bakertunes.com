A joyful piano solo heralding in the dawn chorus. 

Night has passed and the sun begins to rise.

This is the last piece in my collection, *Night Time Impressions* - a series of 8 piano pieces that takes the performer and listener on a journey from dusk to dawn through the darkness of the night.

Soon available from [Forsyths](https://www.forsyths.co.uk/)
