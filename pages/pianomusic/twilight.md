Twilight is a solo piano piece that captures the mysterious moments of twilight, when the day closes and the stars begin to emerge.

The repeated motif in the treble needs a light touch with rubato as the performer feels appropriate. The chordal interludes add the contrasting, unexpected moments as if the night shadows grow. The high staccatos reveal the gentle appearance of stars. 

This is a re-worked version of an earlier piece, written in November 2016 and is now the third piece in my collection, *Night Time Impressions* - a series of 8 piano pieces that takes the performer and listener on a journey from dusk to dawn through the darkness of the night.
