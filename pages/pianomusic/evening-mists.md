A piece for piano solo inspired by the shifting wisps of mist that blur the landscape as evening falls in winter.

It is a re-working of my earlier piece for easy piano,  [*Evening Mist*](https://www.bakertunes.com/pianomusic/evening-mist/).

This is the second piece in my collection,  *Night Time Impressions* - a series of 8 piano pieces that takes the performer and listener on a journey from dusk to dawn through the darkness of the night.

Soon available from [Forsyths](https://www.forsyths.co.uk/)
