Yesterday was a cold but sunny day here in Birmingham. We are lucky enough to have a canal network that takes the walker into hidden parts of Birmingham very quickly. 

My husband, daughter and I walked along a stretch of canal near Hockley Heath and discovered a peaceful, secret world. The water beautifully reflected the autumn colours in the leaves overhead and the bridges framed what looked like entrances into secret grottos.

This piano piece reflects the peacefully and tranquility of that walk.
