Hidden is piece primarily for solo piano with cello and viola accompaniment. 

Winter often seems bleak and colourless, but hidden beneath the surface of the earth are bulbs and seeds waiting for the light and warmth of Spring. As they grow, their hidden beauty is revealed. This piece reflects on beauty that may seem hidden within.
