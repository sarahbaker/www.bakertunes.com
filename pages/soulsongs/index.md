<big>**All of us are unique and experience special moments in our lives. Significant times are always enriched by music.**</big>

During my composing career, I have found that music speaks more intimately than words on so many occasions.

**Soul Songs** are solo piano pieces, composed especially for you. Your unique Soul Song captures what words cannot fully express.

Soul Songs reflect the person they are written for, to mark special moments in life such as the birth of a new baby, a special birthday, or the loss of someone close. Sometimes, a Soul Song is created specially for a person — just for you, or as a gift for a friend or family member.

## How does it work?

I will arrange to chat with you, to hear about the unique moment or significant life event you would like captured in a Soul Song, or the person you would like it created for.

During our chat you will be able to share your story and the meaning and significance of the moment or the person for your Soul Song.

Inspired by your story, your words and emotions, I will create a bespoke piece of music especially for you or your loved one — your unique Soul Song.

**You will receive:**

- a recording of the piece in digital format
- a printed or hand-written score, in a presentation binding or frame

Videos can be ordered according to requirements.
