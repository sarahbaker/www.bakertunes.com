All of us are unique and experience special moments in our lives. Significant times can be enriched by music, and during my composing career, I have found that music speaks more intimately than words on so many occasions.

Soul Songs are solo piano pieces, written especially for the individual, to capture what words cannot fully express. The pieces reflect the person they are written for, to mark special moments in life such as the birth of a new baby, a special birthday, or the loss of someone close.

I will chat with you so you can share your story and, inspired by your words and emotions, I will create a bespoke piece of music especially for you or your loved one. You will receive a recording of the piece and printed or hand-written scores and videos can be ordered according to requirements.
