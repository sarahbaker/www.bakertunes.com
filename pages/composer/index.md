I spent much of my childhood experimenting at the piano and singing. 

By the age of fourteen I had written and performed the background music for three videos for the Bible Society, complete with original songs. My involvement in a local church gave me plenty of opportunity to develop my song-writing and harmonic foundation, and I found composing an expressive outlet during my teenage years.

My BMus(Hons) degree at Birmingham University further developed my expertise and aural awareness, and I focussed on electo-acoustic composition and orchestration in my final year. 

The opportunity to arrange the material for the MusicShakers CDs came at just the right time after a career break to start our family. These CDs allowed me to experiment and work with software to develop my arranging and producing skills. 

My compositional output slowly began to grow, and I eventually became Composer in Residence for [Services For Education](www.servicesforeducation.co.uk) in 2012. Since then I have relished the opportunity to write songs, musicals and piano music for many differnt occasions.
