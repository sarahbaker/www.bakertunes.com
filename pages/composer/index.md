<big><strong>I have composed music since I was eight. My love of singing and melody combines with my interest in the polyphony of the Baroque period and the dissonance of Twentieth Century composers.</strong></big>

I have been Composer in Residence for [Services For Education](https://www.servicesforeducation.co.uk/) since 2012 and have specialised in songs and Musicals for schools and choirs.

My piano compositions are widely played and enjoyed, and combine personal memories and reflections with a musical and  emotional response to everyday experiences. 

I write for all abilities and occasions, using music to express those things that can be hard to put into words.
