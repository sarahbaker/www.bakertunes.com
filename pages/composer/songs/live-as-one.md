This song was written for the national charity, [As One](https://as-one.org/birmingham), which promotes neighbourly friendliness and community well-being. 

The song takes the themes of living as one, being aware of each other's needs and living in friendship with our neighbours.

It is written with simple harmonies, and its lively and positive message make it a wonderful song for choirs of all ages.
