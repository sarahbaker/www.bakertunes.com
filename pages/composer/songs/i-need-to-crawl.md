[*I Need To Crawl*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/flutterpillar) is from my musical [*Flutterpillar*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/flutterpillar) published by Starshine Music. 

There was a summer in my childhood when I collected cabbage white caterpillars from the cabbages and Nasturtiums in our garden, and looked after them in an old iron bath tub. At one stage I think I had over a hundred of them! I know my mum was slightly horrified at the number I had amassed, but I loved watching them grow and how they gradually dispersed from the tub and managed to crawl up the side of the house and transform into chrysalises under the roof eves. 

This song was inspired by these memories and the driving force that caused those caterpillars to crawl so high up the house in order to metamorphose.
