[*We Can All Do Something*](https://www.outoftheark.co.uk/croak.html) is the song that the garden insects sing to Speedy the tadpole in my musical, [*Croak!*](https://www.outoftheark.co.uk/croak.html), published by [Out Of The Ark Music](https://www.outoftheark.co.uk/).

When Speedy loses his tail and so can no longer swim as he once did, he hides away in shame. The garden insects know that he has other skills and encourage him to try and discover what else he can do. *We Can All Do Something* is possibly my favourite song of the musical, as it has a strong message of encouragement and hope to everyone. I hope it gives children the confidence to try new things and discover something that they enjoy doing.

The video is a compilation of all the songs from the musical, with *We Can All Do Something* featuring in the middle.

I have written a [blog](https://blog.bakertunes.com/croak-235becfb447d) about the musical and how my childhood memories inspired the story.
