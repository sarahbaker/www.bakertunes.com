*This Wonderful Earth We Share* is a passionate song, written to describe the beauty of our incredible earth and how urgently we need to make changes to protect our wonderful environment.

The music divides into two parts in the final verses, making it suitable for choral performances.

The video uses photographs that I have taken of different areas in the UK.
