[*Hide Away*](https://www.outoftheark.co.uk/croak.html) is the moving, solo song of my musical, [*Croak!*](https://www.outoftheark.co.uk/croak.html), published by [Out Of The Ark Music](https://www.outoftheark.co.uk/).

Speedy the tadpole was so proud of his swimming. But when he discovers that his tail has disappeared, he wants to hide away, feeling that he can no longer do anything special. This simple song creates a poignant moment in the story as Speedy tries to come to terms with an unexpected change.

The video is a compilation of all the songs from the musical, with *Hide Away* featuring in the middle.

I have written a [blog](https://blog.bakertunes.com/croak-235becfb447d) about the musical and how my childhood memories inspired the story.
