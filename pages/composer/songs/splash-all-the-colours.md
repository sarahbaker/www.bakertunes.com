*Splash All The Colours!* is a fun song for younger singers to celebrate the coming of Spring. Inspired by the ancient Hindu Festival of Colours, or Holi, the lyrics give young children the opportunity to imagine painting rainbows in the sky and to articulate what they enjoy about springtime. As imaginary colours are splashed around, a joyful atmosphere is created and enjoyed by all.

The song was originally written for [SFE](https://www.servicesforeducation.co.uk/) vocal department to share with primary schools in Birmingham.
