The Tudors are a colourful period in history and there is much rich material to delve into for school topics.

I love historical fiction novels and have devoured Phillipa Gregory's Tudor queen series. I was particulalry struck by the story of Lady Jane Grey, and often wonder what our country would be like had she remained on the throne instead of being replaced by Queen Mary.

This fun song reminds us that we mustn't overlook our Nine Days Queen, and helps establish the sequence of events and monarchs of the Tudor period.
