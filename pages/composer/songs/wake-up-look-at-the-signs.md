[*Wake Up!*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/change-the-world-together) is from my musical [*Change The World Together*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/change-the-world-together) published by Starshine Music.

I wanted to write a song that expressed my own sense of frustration when it seems so many people in positions of power deny climate change and refuse to change policies that would help to correct it or stop the damage to our planet. The main character in my musical challenges those in her town to change their ways, and this song comes at a climax point in the production.
