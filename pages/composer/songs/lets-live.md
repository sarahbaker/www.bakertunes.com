Let's Live is a song I have written for the Birmingham Schools Massed Primary Choir. Every summer [Services For Education Music Services](www.servicesforeducation.co.uk) present a series of concerts in Symphony Hall, Birmingham, to showcase the achievements of the musicians in the schools across the city. It is a wonderful week of concerts and one of the highlights is the massed primary choir when up to five hundred children sing together.

I wanted to write a song that encourages the performers and listeners to appreciate the world around them, to celebrate differences and to recognise the wonderful fact that every person is special. It is an uplifting song in a time of political and world change and I hope it proves to be a source of encouragement for those who sing and hear it.
