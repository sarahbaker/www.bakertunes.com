[*They've Been Abaaandoned!*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/magical-christmas-journey) is from my musical [*The Magical Christmas Journey*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/magical-christmas-journey) published by Starshine Music. 

The children in the story encounter a field of sheep, disorientated and confused because their shepherds have run off and left them. Apparently a blinding light and angelic voices disturbed them all in the night and now there are no shepherds. They are not too pleased about this, and this fun tango song gives scope for some grumpy sheep dancing.

This was the first full musical that I wrote and is now also featured on the [Charanga](https://charanga.com/site/) website which is used in primary schools across the UK.
