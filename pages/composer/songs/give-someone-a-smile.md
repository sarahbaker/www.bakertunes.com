*Give Someone A Smile* was written for the [Services For Education](https://www.servicesforeducation.co.uk/) Youth Prom concert at Symphony Hall, Birmingham in 2019.

It was inspired by the message I had seen on banners around the city, promoted by the charity [Permission To Smile](https://permissiontosmile.org/). I loved the idea of people walking along the streets and smiling at one another.

The song is in simple parts, and encourages us all to make our communities friendly places.
