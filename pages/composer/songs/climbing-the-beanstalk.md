This is a song I wrote when my daughter was in year 2 and the topic was Traditional Tales. They were doing work based on the story of Jack and The Beanstalk and I wrote this at the same time as *A Seed So Small* 

I have since used it with many young choirs and find that the children always enjoy singing it. It's one of those songs that makes me feel happier having used it in a session!
