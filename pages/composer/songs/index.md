I have always enjoyed writing new songs and writing lyrics.

My work with [Services For Education Music Services](www.servicesforeducation.co.uk) has given me many opportunities to write new material for all areas of school life. Whether it's for a class assembly or termly project, there is scope for songs about almost anything. It's great to be given a subject and asked if I can write something for a given age group.

Musicals have given me greater opportunities to develop themes and storytelling. I enjoy imagining the production, exploring ideas and using the music to enable children to communicate with an audience, and perhaps experience at a deeper level concepts that they haven't thought much about before. 

I have also written songs for friends and family over the years. I sometimes feel that I can express myself more clearly through music and song.
