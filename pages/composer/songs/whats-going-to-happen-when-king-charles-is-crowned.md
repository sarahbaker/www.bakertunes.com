*What's Going To Happen When King Charles Is Crowned?* is a fun song for young voices exploring what might happen when King Charles III is crowned. 

The lyrics have some repetition for younger children to join in easily, but there are changing elements in the three verses which describe different possibilities for the day. The premise of the song is that we don't know exactly how the day will go, but one thing's for sure - it will dazzle and sparkle!
