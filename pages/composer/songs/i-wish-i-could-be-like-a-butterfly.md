[*I Wish I Could Be Like A Butterfly*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/flutterpillar) is from my musical [*Flutterpillar*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/flutterpillar) published by Starshine Music.

This song was written to try to capture an imagined sense of longing that Caterpillar feels as she looks up at the beautiful butterflies flying around the garden. I spent a lot of my childhood imagining the various creatures in our garden were able to communicate with each other. I loved the idea that the ones that flew would be able to report back to those that were earth-bound and describe what they saw from the sky. These ideas have been central to the main themes of this musical.
