[*Christmas! There's Lots To Get Done*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/magical-christmas-journey) is from my musical [*The Magical Christmas Journey*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/magical-christmas-journey) published by Starshine Music. 

This song is the opening number of the musical, and draws on the sense of hustle and bustle that is often experienced as Christmas approaches.

This was the first full musical that I wrote and is now also featured on the [Charanga](https://charanga.com/site/) website which is used in primary schools across the UK.
