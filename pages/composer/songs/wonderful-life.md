[*Wonderful Life*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/change-the-world-together) is the opening song from my musical [*Change The World Together*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/change-the-world-together) published by Starshine Music. 

The song is a happy reflection on how wonderful life seems when nature is flourishing and the environment around us is healthy. I will always associate writing this song while on a cycling trip to Herefordshire. As I travelled, I was going over the lyrics in my head while enjoying the beautiful views and the sounds of bubbling brooks and birdsong.
