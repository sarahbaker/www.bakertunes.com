*Let Light Shine* is a moving song in simple parts, composed originally for young choirs. It is inspired by the festival of Diwali, and uses images of light shining in the darkness. A simple line change in the three verses highlight the virtues of gladness, goodness and wisdom. 

Simplified versions are available, and the song can easily be adapted for Christmas celebrations by inserting 'candle' for the words 'oil lamp'.
