My friend's baby died in labour in 2011. She was active and healthy in the womb until the placenta ruptured very unexpectedly. 

I had the privilege of holding Florence in the hospital after delivery, and as I looked at her perfect features I was convinced that she had known her family's care and her parents' love during her time in the womb, through feeling their touch and hearing their voices.

This song describes the growing baby and how she knew her family for the brief span of her life.
