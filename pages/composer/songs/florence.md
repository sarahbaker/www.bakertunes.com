My friend's baby, Florence, died in labour in 2011. She was active and healthy in the womb until the placenta ruptured very unexpectedly. 

I had the privilege of holding Florence in the hospital after delivery, and as I looked at her perfect features I was convinced that she had known her family's care and her parents' love during her time in the womb, through feeling their touch and hearing their voices.

I wrote this song for the family in the days following, at a time when it was so hard to put emotions into words. I hope it captured something of Florence as she grew in the womb, aware of her family in that brief span of her life.
