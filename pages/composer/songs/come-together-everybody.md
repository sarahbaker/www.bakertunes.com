*Come Together Everybody* was commissioned by [Services For Education](https://www.servicesforeducation.co.uk/) for the Youth Proms concert series at Symphony Hall in July 2022.

Using themes from HRH Her Majesty The Queen's messages to the Commonwealth in previous games, it promotes togetherness, diversity and inclusion. 

The music is written for SSA and is a joyful call to come together so that the whole community can grow through everyone playing an important part.

The Phoenix International School in Malawi recorded the song as part of a project funded by the Lunar Society in Birmingham. It is a lovely example of how music brings together people from different parts of the world.
