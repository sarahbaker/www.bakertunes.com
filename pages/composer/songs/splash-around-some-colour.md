*Splash Around Some Colour* is a lively song celebrating the coming of Spring. Inspired by the ancient Hindu Festival of Colours, or Holi, the lyrics are positive and fun, embodying the joyful atmosphere as the darkness of Winter passes away. 

The song was originally written for [SFE](https://www.servicesforeducation.co.uk/) vocal department to share with primary schools in Birmingham.
