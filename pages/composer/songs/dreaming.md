Dreaming is a song that I have written for young choirs. It is a song about daydreaming and came to me unexpectedly - I wasn't expecting to write about this at all! Maybe I needed a bit of escapism myself.
It has a dreamy feel and simple two-part harmonies. 

The video is of the Birmingham schools Youth Prom choir singing it at Symphony Hall in July 2018. The Youth Proms were a series of concerts celebrating the incredible music making of young people in the city of Birmingham, organised and taught by the teachers of Services For Education Music Services.
