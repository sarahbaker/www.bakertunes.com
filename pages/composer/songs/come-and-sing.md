[*Come And Sing*](https://www.outoftheark.co.uk/croak.html) is the final song of my musical, [*Croak!*](https://www.outoftheark.co.uk/croak.html), published by [Out Of The Ark Music](https://www.outoftheark.co.uk/).

The song is in simple parts and expresses the happiness that Speedy the tadpole experiences as he is finally able to sing with the frog chorus he has admired for so long.

I have written a [blog](https://blog.bakertunes.com/croak-235becfb447d) about the musical and how my childhood memories inspired the story.
