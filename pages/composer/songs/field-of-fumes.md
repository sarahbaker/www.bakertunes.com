I love it when a song idea makes me giggle! 

[*Field Of Fumes*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/change-the-world-together) is a humourous song based on the facts of methane production by cows and sheep. 

Yes, there are many opportunities for the children to add sound effects, and the song provides a funny moment in my musical, [*Change The World Together*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/change-the-world-together).
