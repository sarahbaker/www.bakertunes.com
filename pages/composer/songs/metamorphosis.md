[Metamorphosis](https://www.outoftheark.co.uk/croak.html) is a lively song published by [Starshine.co.uk](https://www.starshine.co.uk/) about the transformations of insects - *a very big word for a very big change, when creatures wonderfully rearrange*. 

It was inspired by childhood memories of lying on my stomach in the grass, staring deeply into the waters of our garden pond. I saw many different varieties of pond life and often wondered what it must be like for them as they made their transitions from water creatures to insects in the world above. This song has verses about caterpillars, tadpoles and the dragonfly larva.

The same memories eventually led me to write my musical, [Croak!](https://www.outoftheark.co.uk/croak.html)
