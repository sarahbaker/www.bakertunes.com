*There Is A Stream* was commissioned by Alvechurch Community Choir to celebrate the centenary of the end of World War One. 

I wanted to write a song that invoked a vision of a peaceful world through the medium of nature and the environment. I had a picture of the life-giving waters of a stream, flowing through the countryside and bringing nourishment and health. I then imagined a tree that stands the test of time and symbolises strength and protection. The two images seemed to represent for me a sense of hope and peace for the future, despite the war-torn world that we experience currently.
