[*The Storm*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/change-the-world-together) is an atmospheric and dramatic song from my musical [*Change The World Together*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/change-the-world-together) published by Starshine Music.

We are increasingly seeing how global warming brings extreme weather conditions and this song describes the building tension and devastating effects of an unexpected storm.

It has two-part sections and uses whispered vocalising to add dranatic effect.
