Transformations are a collection of six pieces for solo piano written during 2020 now available as an EP on various music platforms, including [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/7yNVk50pBNyDLqNCvvIfaF?si=PBR7TTV-RZaz-fQKd6MSKQ). Many of them have been played on the Sleeping Forecast on BBC Sounds.

Each piece explores my feelings and thoughts during this unusual and difficult time and provide a varied and expressive musical illustration of my different moods and emotions.
Music played a very important role in helping me navigate my experience of lockdown and also provided an opportunity for processing some of the strange new impressions that the COVID-19 pandemic created.
