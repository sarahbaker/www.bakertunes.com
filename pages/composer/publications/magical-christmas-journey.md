**_Magical Christmas Journey_ is a nativity musical full of character, warmth and humour. The story is clear and simple, the songs are exceptionally easy to learn and the script is easy to follow. With lots of actions provided for the songs and a good pace to the dialogue, there is plenty to keep the children engaged. An easy narrated version is also included.**

The children are almost ready for Christmas when the magic begins to happen. They find they have a talking Christmas tree!  No sooner do they mention the need for a star to go on top of this tree, than they are surrounded by stars - who also seem able to talk! As if that wasnâ€™t magical enough, one of these stars leads the children on an amazing journey, during which they find much more than the star to decorate their tree!
