**9 pieces for solo piano inspired by memories from childhood**

Suitable for players between grades 3-5 standard, these evocative sound pieces begin at the tranquility of dusk and move through the dark shadows of night to the exuberant and joyful dawn chorus.

All the pieces are inspired by memories of growing up with woods behind my house, and the sounds and images that linger in my mind from childhood. 

I'm delighted that *Shadows* is now on the ABRSM 2025-26 syllabus as an alternative piece in List A.
