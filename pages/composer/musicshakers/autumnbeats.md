*Autumn Beat and Dancing Feet* Get set to dance and sing along with this colourful collection of autumnal songs from Music Shakers.

There are gentle lullabies of falling leaves, endearing chants about bushy-tailed squirrels and traditional harvest time dances amongst these seasonal favourites.

Marching ants, wrinkly elephants, Native Americans and Zulu warriors round out this varied mix of music from across the worldâ€™s cultures.
