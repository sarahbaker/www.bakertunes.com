A lot of my music is composed using a midi keyboard and Logic Pro X on a Mac computer. 

I have done all the arrangements for my songs in this way and love the huge variety of instruments available to me.

Sometimes the timbre of an instrument itself will inspire melodies and styles, and occasionally I accidentally come across loops or effects that transform my arrangement.

This is an area of constant experiment and growth which I hope to develop more in the future.
