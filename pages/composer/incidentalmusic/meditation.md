Originally written in September 2018,  *Meditation* is a gentle piece of instrumental music, composed for piano, trumpet and saxophone. Pizzicato strings provide movement and texture. 

The video uses photographs from walks I've taken in the English countryside. Many of them have incredible cloud formations and capture a beautiful sense of space and openness. 

The music reflects this sense of tranquility and beauty. It isn't rushed, but instead, makes the most of an expansive sense of phrase and melody. The instruments share the melody between them, lingering on the notes, sometimes in harmony, sometimes as a solo.
