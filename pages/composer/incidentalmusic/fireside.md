Fireside is a relaxing piece of piano music with instrumental accompaniment, arranged on LogicProX. It has a feel-good quality and gently builds and then subsides. I called it Fireside as it reminds me of relaxing evenings by our living room fire, feeling warm and at peace with the world.

The video shows the LogicProX score as it unfolds with the music.
