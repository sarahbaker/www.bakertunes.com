It feels as if the world is rapidly transforming and changing. Simple things that were so insignificant are now transformed in a disturbing way. There is a longing for the restoration of the familiar.

*It changes around me* is a piece that unexpectedly shifts and moves tonality and merges dissonance with resolution as if describing that sense of yearning in the midst of transition.

I am very grateful to pianist, Yuki Negishi, for recording this for me.

Played on BBC Sound's [Sleeping Forecast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0h081mm?partner=uk.co.bbc&origin=share-mobile) on 18th December 2023 and 8th November 2023.

Now available to listen to as part of my *Transformations* EP on several music platforms including [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/2YaKZAjjs56dGFV8hyRQHV?si=94d63480ae1d47fa)
