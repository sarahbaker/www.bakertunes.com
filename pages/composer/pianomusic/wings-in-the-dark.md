A piece for solo piano describing the flight of owls and bats as they swoop and flit through the woods at night.

This is the 6th piece in my collection, *Night Time Impressions* - a series of 8 piano pieces that takes the performer and listener on a journey from dusk to dawn through the darkness of the night.
