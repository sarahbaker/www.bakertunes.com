I was fortunate to have several children of my own age living close by. We seemed to be forever making dens, playing out in the street and generally enjoying each othersâ€™ company. This piece reflects that sense of well-being.


This is a re-working of an earlier piece, [*Contentment*](https://www.bakertunes.com/pianomusic/contentment/)

Inspired by childhood memories, *Friends* is part of a collection of pieces for intermediate piano, [*Day Time Impressions*](/composer/publications/day-time-impressions/). They complement my earlier works, [*Night Time Impressions*.](/composer/publications/night-time-impressions/)

Available to buy from [Forsyths](https://www.forsyths.co.uk/music/forsyth-publications/forsyth-publications-by-instrument/piano/148406-day-time-impressions-sarah-baker-piano-sheet-music-9790570500192.html)
