When I'm composing I often have images in my mind. This piano piece was written in this way.

For The Journey, I imagined a landscape that was open, dusty and rocky, with a traveller making his way towards an unknown destination.

He has been walking for some time now and aches, but his feet keep moving forward, one in front of the other, seemingly detached from his mind.

Although his body is tired, his mind is still able to wonder and he remembers the beauty of things previously seen.
