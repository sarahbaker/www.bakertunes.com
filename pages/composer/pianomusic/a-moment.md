Moments. Fleeting fragments of time, here one minute and then wisping away like mist. 

This piece has short snatches of melody, musical moments that come and go. 

The pedal blurs the harmonies, purposefully blending the sounds, just as mist shifts, obscuring the view one minute and then clearing to reveal the unexpected.
