This piece for solo piano was commissioned as a Soul Song to commemorate the life of a dear friend and wife.

The music combines two contrasting themes to reflect the loving relationship of two special and individual people.

As the unique qualities of the themes are refined and enhanced by each other, so the melody is altered and developed, leading to a joyful conclusion.

<span class="script-font script-text">I have played a number of Sarah's compositions and enjoyed them. When she expressed interest in composing pieces for special occasions (Soul Songs), I felt it would be an opportunity to have a piece that celebrated my wife who died of cancer and the 45 years that we had together.
