This piece for solo piano was commissioned as a Soul Song to commemorate the life of a dear friend and wife.

The music combines two contrasting themes to reflect the loving relationship of two special and individual people.

As the unique qualities of the themes are refined and enhanced by each other, so the melody is altered and developed, leading to a joyful conclusion.
