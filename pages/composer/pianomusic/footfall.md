I imagine a village square where people are crossing at various times to get to the other side. Sometimes they acknowledge one another and sometimes they just go on their way.

There is a steady flow, and some unexpected moments.

This piano piece contrasts the steady flow of the left hand with more unexpected motifs in the right.
