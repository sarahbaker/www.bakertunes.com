I love watching the clouds. Their peaceful movement and shifting shapes brings a sense of space and tranquility which I have tried to capture in this ethereal piece for piano solo.

Played on BBC Sound's [Sleeping Forecast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0hwp5k3?partner=uk.co.bbc&origin=share-mobile) on 8th May, 2024
