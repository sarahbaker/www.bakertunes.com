I recollect many mornings stuck in traffic as my Dad took me to school on his way to work. There is basically one main road out of the village I grew up, and that got more and more congested the closer we got to the main town. My Dad and I never talked much, but it was always good to be together, lost in our own thoughts.



Inspired by childhood memories, *Morning Commute* is part of a collection of pieces for intermediate piano, [*Day Time Impressions*](https://www.bakertunes.com/pianomusic/day-time-impressions/). They complement my earlier works, [*Night Time Impressions*.](https://www.bakertunes.com/pianomusic/night-time-impressions/)
