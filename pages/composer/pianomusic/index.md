I've loved composing since I got my first Casio keyboard for Christmas when I was eight. Through my piano teaching and arranging work I have many opportunities to hear new pieces and love seeing pupils experimenting with different styles.

As I compose I find that my pieces seem to take on a life of their own and I enjoy exploring my own harmonic language and style, influenced by my love of polyphnic textures and dissonance. I often start with a pictorial concept or idea, and a simple melodic motif which comes through experimenting and improvising at the piano. I then go with the flow! I love the way that ideas and images seem to come to mind as the melodic shape and harmonies find their voice.

Please feel free to download the scores for these and share.
