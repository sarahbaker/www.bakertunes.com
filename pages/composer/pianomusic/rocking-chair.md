In my bedroom there is a rocking chair. It used to belong to my husband's grandmother and we inherited it when we got married. I used to sit in it and nurse my daughters when they were babies.

Most of the time it stays very still now, but occasionally it gets moved and its gentle rocking reminds me of those peaceful night times, cuddling my little ones.

This piano piece is a calm piece, reflecting the peaceful motion of the rocking chair in the corner.
