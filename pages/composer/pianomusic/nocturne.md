Night is a time of sleep and shadows, tranquility and terror. This Nocturne is a gentle piece contrasting an atmosphere of rest and repose with the flitting dreamlike disturbances that can unsettle and unnerve.

The disturbance of night gives way to light and the approach of dawn brings a sense of resolution.

This is the seventh piece in my collection, *Night Time Impressions* - a series of 8 piano pieces that takes the performer and listener on a journey from dusk to dawn through the darkness of the night.
