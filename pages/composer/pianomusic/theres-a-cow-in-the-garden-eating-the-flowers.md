Inspired by the memory of seeing an unexpected cow in the garden! This surreal image is captured in this quirky waltz, as I portray both the absurdity of the moment and the sense of wonder I felt as a child, looking out of the window and seeing the cow walking round and eating the flowers.


Inspired by childhood memories, *There's A Cow In The Garden Eating The Flowers* is part of a collection of pieces for intermediate piano, [*Day Time Impressions*](/composer/publications/day-time-impressions/). They complement my earlier works, [*Night Time Impressions*.](/composer/publications/night-time-impressions/)
