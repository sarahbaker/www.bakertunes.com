One vivid memory I have as a child is of the day that a hot air balloon passed over our house and made an emergency landing on the road in front. The sound of the gas being blown into the balloon to try to keep it high enough to pass the house sounded so loud and intimidating, and then there was the bustle of the neighbours as we all went out into the street to watch. It was both terrifying and exhilarating to watch the balloon float by and then land so near by.


Inspired by childhood memories, *Air Balloon!* is part of a collection of pieces for intermediate piano, [*Day Time Impressions*](/composer/publications/day-time-impressions/). They complement my earlier works, [*Night Time Impressions*.](/composer/publications/night-time-impressions/)
