Contentment is a happy piece for solo piano.

I find myself singing this melody round the house and I hope it gives performers a good, positive feeling too.

The main melody needs a good, singing tone. Enjoy the rising bass notes of the left hand accompaniment and the small changes in the broken chord patterns.
