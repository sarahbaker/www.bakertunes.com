This is the second piano piece I wrote during the time my father was in hospital recovering from a road traffic accident. He had suffered head injuries and for a while we were not sure what the outcome would be. However, he slowly began to speak and act more like himself, his personality and character emerging slowly through the fog of brain injury.

The main theme of the music gradually develops to mirror this emergence.
