I have taken inspiration from the memories of the movement and noises of the trees and animal life in the woods where I grew up. Night was a time when sounds took on new meanings, and things became unfamiliar and disconcerting. My imagination ran riot and the woods became alive with unknown beings.

This is the fourth piece in my collection, *Night Time Impressions* - a series of 8 piano pieces that takes the performer and listener on a journey from dusk to dawn through the darkness of the night. I'm delighted that it has been selected for the ABRSM Grade 3 piano syllabus, 2025-26. A short blog about the piece can be found [here](https://medium.com/@bakertunes/shadows-20dcfb3566b9)
