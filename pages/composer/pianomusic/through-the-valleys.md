testimonial: 
  quote: "The piece of music which Sarah wrote for me left me speechless. It was intelligently composed, thoughtfully written and multi-textured. Sarah managed to translate my innermost thoughts into a wonderful piece which I will treasure for the rest of my life. She has essentially bequeathed me a musical mirror to look into and understand myself, my journey and my dreams. What a wonderful gift."
