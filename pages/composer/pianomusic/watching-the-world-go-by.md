A short, reflective piece, remembering what it was like to have time to just sit and watch the world go by from my bedroom window.

This piece is a re-working of my earlier piece, [*Footfall*](https://www.bakertunes.com/pianomusic/footfall/)

Inspired by childhood memories, *Watching The World Go By* is part of a collection of pieces for intermediate piano, [*Day Time Impressions*](https://www.bakertunes.com/pianomusic/day-time-impressions/). They complement my earlier works, [*Night Time Impressions*.](https://www.bakertunes.com/pianomusic/night-time-impressions/)

Soon available from [Forsyths](https://www.forsyths.co.uk/)
