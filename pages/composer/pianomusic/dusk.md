Dusk describes to me a period of the day when there is time for reflection and meditation. 

It brings to my mind the setting sun and that in-between world between day and night when the busy-ness of the day is done and night is gradually drawing closer.

The light changes and things seem different.

There is hope of rest and maybe the company of friends round the table for a meal.

This is the first piece in my collection, *Night Time Impressions* - a series of 8 piano pieces that takes the performer and listener on a journey from dusk to dawn through the darkness of the night.
