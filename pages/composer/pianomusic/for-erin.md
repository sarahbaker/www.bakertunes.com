I have known Erin for many years and love her bubbly, vivacious personality. She also has a deep, thoughtful and contemplative side, and it was this aspect of her character that I wanted to capture in my music for her 50th birthday.

This music reflects this meditative quality, and was given to Erin on her birthday.
