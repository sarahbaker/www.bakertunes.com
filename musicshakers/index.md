[Music Shakers](http://www.musicshakers.com/) has been a very important part of my musical work. I have produced seven albums full of the amazingly varied songs and rhymes of the Music Shakers classes. This was a large, collaborative project that took several years to complete: Marcella Erskine collected the songs, I arranged and composed them and, together with Fiona Howe, we recorded them with a choir of local Birmingham children. 

I'm very proud of the final products and think they are a wonderful resource for children and families.
